5 rules of pseudocode.
The fist thing the video creator said was there were no rules in pseudocode. However, here is what I surmised while watching the videos.
1. Demonstrate Flexibility of use while maintaining readability for others.
2. Use declare or define for variables and separate similar types with a comma on one line.
3. Separate out logic with a blank line.
4. Align blocks of pseudocode appropriately using indentation.
5. Use Start and End statements to define the start and end of the pseudocode block.
